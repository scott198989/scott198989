- ##Content

  Through out my various personal repositories you will find several projects; some of which where from my time as a student at
  LEARN Academy, others are projects I have done on my own.
  All either have simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some are front end only applications using React.js, others are full stack
  applications using React.js and Rails. The dependencies needed to run
  these applications are listed in their respective README.md files.
