- 👋 Hi, I am Scott Tuschl, and thank you for viewing my GitHub page.
-  I am a full-stack web developer with experience in React.js and Ruby on Rails (PostgreSQL) frameworks.
-  I’m currently furthering my knowledge base on the intricacies of these languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and testing applications and suites.
-  I enjoy creating fascinating, responsive web pages that immerse the user in a type of lasting experience instead of simply just visiting a web page.
- 📫 I can be easily reached via email at scott-tuschl@comcast.net, or you can also visit my linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/scott-tuschl or my portfolio at https://www.scott-tuschl.com , and once again, THANK YOU very much for taking the time to visit my GitHub!

  ## Content:
  
-  Throughout my various personal repositories, you will find several projects; some of which were from my time as a student at LEARN Academy, and others are projects I have done on my own. All either have simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; some are front-end only applications using React.js, while others are full-stack applications using React.js and Rails. The dependencies needed to run these applications are listed in their respective README.md files.  Please feel free to visit the Project Repositories README to find a full list of links to my repo's.
