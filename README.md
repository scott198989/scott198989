- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Scott Tuschl, and thank you for viewing my GitHub page.
-  I am a full-stack web developer with experience in React.js and Ruby on Rails (PostgreSQL) frameworks.
-  Iâ€™m currently furthering my knowledge base on the intricacies of these languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and testing applications and suites.
-  I enjoy creating fascinating, responsive web pages that immerse the user in a type of lasting experience instead of simply just visiting a web page.
- ðŸ“« I can be easily reached via email at scott-tuschl@comcast.net, or you can also visit my linkedin at https://www.linkedin/in/scott-tuschl or my portfolio at www.linkedin.com/in/scott-tuschl , and once again, THANK YOU very much for taking the time to visit my GitHub!

  ##Content
-  Throughout my various personal repositories, you will find several projects; some of which were from my time as a student at LEARN Academy, and others are projects I have done on my own. All either have simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; some are front-end only applications using React.js, while others are full-stack applications using React.js and Rails. The dependencies needed to run these applications are listed in their respective README.md files.
