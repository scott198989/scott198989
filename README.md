- 👋 Hi, I am Scott Tuschl, and thank you for viewing my GitHub page.
-  I am a full stack web developer with experience in Ract.js and Ruby on Rails (PostgreSQL) frame works.
-  I’m currently furthering my knowledge base on the intrecasies of these languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and testing applications and suites.
-  I enjoy creating facisinating, repsonvie webpages that immerse the user in a type of lasting experience instead of simply just visiting a web page.
- 📫 I can be easily reached via email scott-tuschl@comcast.net, and once again, THANK YOU very much for taking the time to visit my GitHub!

- ##Content

  Through out my various personal repositories you will find several projects; some of which were from my time as a student at LEARN Academy, others are projects I have done on my own. All either have simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some are front end only applications using React.js, others are full stack applications using React.js and Rails. The dependencies needed to run these applications are listed in their respective README.md files.
